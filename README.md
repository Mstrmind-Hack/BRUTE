What is BRUTE?

**BRUTE** (Version 1.0) is a URI, URL, and subdomain brute-forcer created for Linux.

It can be used to brute-force Directories, Files (depending on word lists supplied), and also subdomains.

What is so special about this “NEW”  Directory and subdomain brute-forcer? 

Ease of use! 

I used an awesome python library called simple_termi_menu to create many different menus to help the absolute beginner use this tool on the Command Line interface (CLI).

Dirb, Gobuster and many of the other similar tools are phenomenal!

I built BRUTE to make my life easier, and to gain a greater understanding of how this all works!

I also added the ability for the user to select from a given set of world lists (most of them can be found in Kali Linux and through github 
[I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE WORD LISTS! CREDITS GO TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS]).

I also added the ability for users to add or remove custom word lists as they wish.

BRUTE Version 1.0 can also detect redirects and the “First and Last” destination redirect hops, and response size.

BRUTE  is an **active reconnaissance** tool If used on targets without their written concent will land you  with legal issues and I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE! 
Further improvements and additions will be made as time goes on. 

For the next versions, I am hoping to add API Fuzzing and attack support.

I am the only developer for this tool, I welcome support and donations as they keep my projects active. =]
